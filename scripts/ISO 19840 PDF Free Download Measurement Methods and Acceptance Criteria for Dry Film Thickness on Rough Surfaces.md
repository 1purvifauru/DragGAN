# How to Download ISO 19840 PDF for Free
 
ISO 19840 is an international standard that specifies a procedure for the verification of dry-film thickness against nominal dry-film thickness on rough surfaces, such as steel structures that are protected by paint systems. It covers the adjustment of the instruments used, the definition of inspection areas, sampling plans, measurement methods and acceptance/rejection criteria.

ISO 19840 is a useful standard for anyone who is involved in the corrosion protection of steel structures by protective paint systems. It provides a consistent and reliable method for measuring the thickness of dry films on rough surfaces, which is an important factor for ensuring the performance and durability of the coating system.
 
Some of the benefits of using ISO 19840 are:

- It helps to avoid under- or over-application of the coating, which can lead to premature failure, increased maintenance costs, or wasted material.
- It ensures compliance with the specifications and requirements of the coating system, as well as with relevant regulations and standards.
- It improves the quality control and quality assurance of the coating process, by providing clear and objective criteria for acceptance or rejection.
- It reduces the risk of disputes and claims between contractors, clients, and inspectors, by providing a common reference and a traceable documentation.

To use ISO 19840, you will need a suitable instrument that can measure the dry-film thickness on rough surfaces using a magnetic field or an eddy current. The instrument should be calibrated and adjusted according to the standard's procedure, using smooth reference standards and calibration foils. You will also need to define the inspection areas and sampling plans according to the standard's guidelines, and measure the dry-film thickness at multiple points within each inspection area. The average and minimum values of the measurements should be compared with the nominal dry-film thickness and the acceptance criteria specified by the standard.
