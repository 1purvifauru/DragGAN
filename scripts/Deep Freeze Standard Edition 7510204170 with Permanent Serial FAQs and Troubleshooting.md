Deep Freeze is a software that helps you protect your computer from unwanted changes and malicious attacks. It works by freezing your system configuration and restoring it to the original state every time you reboot your computer. This way, you can enjoy a consistent and trouble-free computing experience.
 
However, if you want to use Deep Freeze for a long time, you need a permanent serial number that can activate the software without expiration. The serial number that comes with the ThumperDC setup has expired as of date, so you need to use a different one that is still valid.

Freeze-drying is not only used for preserving pharmaceuticals and biological samples, but also for many types of foods. Some of the common foods that are freeze-dried are:

- Fruits: such as strawberries, blueberries, bananas, apples, mangoes, pineapples, etc.
- Vegetables: such as corn, peas, carrots, broccoli, spinach, etc.
- Meat: such as beef, chicken, turkey, pork, etc.
- Dairy: such as cheese, yogurt, milk, etc.
- Coffee: such as instant coffee or coffee beans.
- Herbs and spices: such as basil, oregano, parsley, garlic, ginger, etc.

Freeze-dried foods have many advantages over fresh or canned foods. They retain most of their nutrients and phytochemicals that may otherwise be lost during cooking or processing. They also have a long shelf life and can be stored at room temperature without refrigeration. They are lightweight and easy to transport and prepare. They can be rehydrated quickly by adding water or eaten as snacks.
