The game takes place in the Kingdom of Lothric, a land where the First Flame, the source of life and order, is fading. The player assumes the role of an Unkindled, an undead warrior who failed to link the fire in the past and was resurrected to do so again. The player must travel across Lothric and beyond, fighting powerful enemies and bosses, collecting souls and items, and interacting with various characters and factions. The game features a nonlinear world design, allowing the player to explore different areas in any order they choose. The game also features online multiplayer modes, such as co-operative play, player versus player (PvP) invasions, and dedicated arenas.

If you are new to Dark Souls 3 or the Souls series in general, you may find the game quite challenging and unforgiving. However, with some tips and tricks, you can improve your chances of survival and enjoy the game more. Here are some of the essential things you should know before you play Dark Souls 3.
 
- Save your souls: When you defeat enemies, they may drop soul items that can be used to gain additional souls by activating them from your inventory. These items stay with you when you die, unlike the souls you collect from killing enemies, which can be lost if you don't retrieve them after dying. Therefore, it's wise to save these items until you are ready to spend them at Firelink Shrine, where you can level up your character or buy items. You should also save the boss soul items you get from defeating bosses, as they can be traded for special weapons and items later in the game.
- Allot your Estus: In Dark Souls 3, you have two types of flasks that can be used to recover: the Estus Flask for health and the Ashen Estus Flask for focus points (FP), which are used for special skills and spells. You can adjust the allocation of your flasks between Estus and Ashen Estus at Blacksmith Andre in Firelink Shrine, depending on your play style and needs. You can also increase the number of flasks you have by finding Estus Shards and bringing them to Andre, and increase their effectiveness by finding Undead Bone Shards and burning them at the bonfire in Firelink Shrine.
- Get an early boost: There is a shortcut in Firelink Shrine that can help you get some useful items early in the game. Opposite the entrance to the locked tower, there is a tree that you can run up and jump over to the rooftop ledge. From there, you can explore the roof and find a Crystal Lizard that drops a Twinkling Titanite, an Estus Shard, a Fire Keeper Soul (which can be given to the Fire Keeper to heal your Dark Sigils), and a Crow's Nest where you can trade items with a crow for other items.

Dark Souls 3 is a game that rewards exploration, experimentation, and learning from your mistakes. By following these tips and tricks, you can make your journey easier and more enjoyable. Good luck, Ashen One!
