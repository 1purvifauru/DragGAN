Deseo (2013) is a Mexican comedy-drama film directed by Antonio Zavala Kugler and based on Arthur Schnitzler's controversial play Reigen (1897), which explores the sexual and social relations of different characters from various backgrounds and classes. The film consists of eight interconnected stories that revolve around desire, love, power, and disappointment, set in contemporary Mexico.
 
The film features a star-studded cast of Mexican actors, such as Christian Bach, Ari Borovoy, Pedro Damian, Edith Gonzalez, Paulina Goto, Leonor Varela, and others. The film has been praised for its witty dialogue, sensual scenes, and exquisite selection of music. However, some critics have also pointed out the film's lack of depth, originality, and coherence.

Deseo (2013) is a cinematic gem that offers a glimpse into the diverse and complex realities of Mexican society, where sexual desire is often influenced by class, race, and moral prejudices. The film also raises questions about the possibility of true love and intimacy in a world where people are constantly searching for fulfillment and happiness.
  
The film begins with a teenage prostitute (Paulina Goto) who meets a sailor (Ari Borovoy) in a hotel room. They have sex and then part ways. The sailor then encounters a married woman (Edith Gonzalez) who is unhappy with her husband (Pedro Damian), a politician. They have an affair and she confesses her love for him, but he rejects her. The politician then meets a young actress (Geraldine Bazan) who is trying to get a role in his campaign. They have sex and he promises to help her, but he doesn't. The actress then meets a famous writer (Leonardo Garcia Valle) who is suffering from writer's block. They have sex and he gets inspired by her, but he doesn't acknowledge her. The writer then meets a schoolgirl (Paola Nunez) who is his fan. They have sex and he gives her a signed copy of his book, but he doesn't care about her. The schoolgirl then meets a soldier (Jorge Luis Moreno) who is on leave. They have sex and she falls in love with him, but he leaves her. The soldier then meets a widow (Leonor Varela) who is mourning her husband. They have sex and she feels alive again, but he doesn't stay with her. The widow then meets a priest (Christian Bach) who is her confessor. They have sex and she feels guilty, but he doesn't repent. The priest then meets the teenage prostitute, who is his niece. They have sex and he pays her, but he doesn't protect her.

The film ends with a circular structure, showing how desire connects and disconnects people from different backgrounds and situations, without leading to love or happiness. The film also shows how desire is influenced by social norms and expectations, as well as by personal needs and fantasies. The film is a provocative and humorous adaptation of Schnitzler's play, which was banned for decades for its explicit depiction of sexuality and its critique of morality.
