WinTOPO Pro 3.7.0.0 (x64) 23 is a software application that can convert images from scanners and other digital sources into vector data suitable for CAD, GIS and CNC systems[^1^]. You can scan old plans, archive drawings, or even photos and convert them into useful CAD data. Any image which is stored in TIFF, GIF, JPEG, PNG or BMP format can be processed by WinTOPO Pro into DXF and other vector file formats[^1^].

WinTOPO Pro has many advantages over other raster to vector conversion software. It has more processing options and finer control over the vectorisation process[^1^]. It has a one-touch vectorisation button that makes it easy to use[^2^]. It can recognise arcs and fit smooth curves to the image[^2^]. It can also vectorise colour images into colour CAD drawings, which is a rare feature in other systems[^2^]. It has a powerful georeference feature that ensures that your vectors will be scaled, rotated, translated and deskewed to the correct coordinates ready for your CAD/GIS/CNC system[^2^]. It also has a digitising and vector editing function that allows you to assign levels to the vectors[^2^].
 
WinTOPO Pro 3.7.0.0 (x64) 23 is the latest version of WinTOPO Pro, which was released on August 12, 2015[^2^]. It is available in both 32 bit and 64 bit versions. The 64 bit version is able to process larger images due to the larger memory available to 64 bit applications[^2^]. It also has some bug fixes and improvements over the previous versions[^2^].
 
WinTOPO Pro 3.7.0.0 (x64) 23 is a high quality product that produces high quality results. It is based on established research findings on raster vectorisation and enhanced with the very latest research findings to give you the best possible results[^2^]. It is used by major industries worldwide, such as NASA , Microsoft, MIT, British Telecom, BAE Systems, Motorola, EDS, and many branches of the US Department of Defence[^2^]. You can download and try it out for free from the official website[^1^], but you need a license to save the full result (a sample of the vector result can be saved in non-licensed mode)[^2^]. WinTOPO Pro is priced to be affordable and it includes support in the license purchase price[^2^].
 
If you are looking for a software that can convert your images into useful vector files for your CAD/GIS/CNC system, you should definitely check out WinTOPO Pro 3.7.0.0 (x64) 23.

WinTOPO Pro 3.7.0.0 (x64) 23 is also easy to use and compatible with other CAD software. You can load a raster image from various formats, such as BMP, TIF, GIF, JPG, PNG, etc., or acquire it from a scanner or a camera[^2^]. Then you can click the one-touch vectorisation button and let WinTOPO Pro do the rest[^2^]. You can also adjust the settings and options to fine-tune the vectorisation process according to your needs[^2^]. After the vectorisation is done, you can save the vectors in DXF or other formats that can be opened and edited in any CAD application[^2^]. For example, you can use WinTOPO Pro as an add-on for progeCAD Professional, which is a powerful and affordable CAD software that supports DWG files[^4^]. You can easily convert your images into CAD drawings with WinTOPO Pro and progeCAD Professional[^4^].
