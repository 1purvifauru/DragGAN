# How to Register EViews 9 Using a Serial Number Generator
 
EViews 9 is a powerful statistical software that offers researchers, corporations, government agencies, and students access to various tools for data analysis, forecasting, and modeling. However, to use EViews 9, you need to register it with a valid serial number. A serial number is a 16 or 24-character code that identifies your copy of EViews and allows you to activate it online or offline.
 
If you do not have a serial number, you can use a serial number generator to create one. A serial number generator is a program that generates random codes that can be used to register EViews 9. However, using a serial number generator is illegal and may cause problems with your software or system. Therefore, we do not recommend using a serial number generator and advise you to purchase a legitimate license from the official website of EViews.
