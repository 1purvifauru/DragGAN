Slide2 is a powerful and comprehensive software for slope stability analysis. It is used by engineers and researchers around the world for various applications. By downloading Slide2 by Rocscience, you can benefit from its features and capabilities.
  
Slide2 is based on the limit equilibrium method, which is a widely accepted technique for slope stability analysis. Slide2 can handle complex geometries, multiple slip surfaces, circular and non-circular failure modes, and various types of supports and reinforcements. Slide2 also allows you to perform sensitivity and probabilistic analyses to account for uncertainty and variability in the input parameters.
 
One of the advantages of Slide2 is its integration with other Rocscience products. For example, you can import your model from Slide3, which is a software for 3D slope stability analysis. You can also use RS2 to perform a shear strength reduction analysis on your Slide2 model. Moreover, you can load your RSPile file in Slide2 and use the resistance functions in your slope stability analyses. You can also import your cross-sections from RSLog, which is a software for borehole logging and visualization.
 
Slide2 has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to create and edit models, run analyses, and view results. You can use the built-in drawing tools or import DXF files to create your geometry. You can also use the material library or define your own materials with various strength models. You can assign groundwater conditions, pore pressure options, and seepage analysis settings. You can also define supports such as anchors, piles, nails, geosynthetics, and retaining walls. Slide2 has a powerful search engine that can find the most critical slip surfaces using different methods such as grid search, random search, block search, or user-defined surfaces. You can also use the multi-modal optimization feature to find the top three most critical slip surfaces at once. Slide2 provides various output options such as charts, tables, diagrams, reports, and animations. You can also export your results to other formats such as Excel, PDF, or CSV.
