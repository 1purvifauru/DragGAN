Title: How to Use Bias SoundSoap 2 to Remove Noise from Your Music  Article:  Bias SoundSoap 2 is a software application that can help you remove unwanted noise from your digital audio or video files. Whether you are dealing with clicks, pops, hum, rumble, hiss, or any other type of noise, SoundSoap 2 can help you clean up your recordings and make them sound better. In this article, we will show you how to use SoundSoap 2 as a standalone program or as a plug-in with your favorite host application.  
## What is Bias SoundSoap 2?
  Bias SoundSoap 2 is a noise reduction and restoration software that works with both Mac and Windows platforms. It can run as a standalone application or as a plug-in with compatible host programs, such as Apple GarageBand, Adobe Premiere, MOTU Digital Performer, Steinberg Cubase, Digidesign Pro Tools, Sony Sound Forge, and more[^4^] [^5^].  SoundSoap 2 has four main sections: Hum & Rumble filters, Click & Crackle elimination, Broadband noise reduction, and Noise Gate. Each section has its own controls and settings that allow you to fine-tune the noise removal process. You can also use the Learn Noise button to automatically analyze the noise profile of your audio file and adjust the parameters accordingly[^4^].  
## How to Use Bias SoundSoap 2 as a Standalone Application?
  To use SoundSoap 2 as a standalone application, you need to follow these steps:  1. Launch SoundSoap 2 from your Applications folder (Mac) or Start menu (Windows). 2. Click on the Open button and select an audio or video file that you want to fix. You can also drag and drop the file onto the SoundSoap 2 window. Note that SoundSoap 2 supports most common file formats, except for MPEG-1 and MPEG-2[^5^]. 3. Play back the file and listen for any noise problems. You can use the Before/After button to compare the original and processed audio. 4. Use the Hum & Rumble filters to remove low-frequency noise such as ground loops, air conditioners, or traffic rumble. You can adjust the frequency and slope of the filters using the sliders or knobs. 5. Use the Click & Crackle elimination to remove high-frequency noise such as vinyl pops, tape hiss, or digital glitches. You can adjust the sensitivity and threshold of the detection algorithm using the sliders or knobs. 6. Use the Broadband noise reduction to remove general background noise such as white noise, fan noise, or room ambience. You can choose between two modes: Manual or Automatic. In Manual mode, you need to select a portion of the audio that contains only noise (no signal) and click on the Learn Noise button. This will create a noise fingerprint that will be used to reduce the noise throughout the file. In Automatic mode, you don't need to select a noise-only section; instead, SoundSoap 2 will adaptively analyze and reduce the noise as it plays back[^4^]. 7. Use the Noise Gate to silence any sections of the audio that fall below a certain level. This can help remove any residual noise that may still be present after applying the other sections. You can adjust the threshold and release time of the gate using the sliders or knobs. 8. Once you are satisfied with the results, click on the Save button and choose a destination and format for your cleaned-up file. Note that you cannot save your file as MP3 in standalone mode; you need to use a separate encoder for that[^5^].  
## How to Use Bias SoundSoap 2 as a Plug-in?
  To use SoundSoap 2 as a plug-in, you need to follow these steps:  1. Launch your host application and open or create a project that contains an audio or video track that you want to fix. 2. Insert SoundSoap 2 as an effect plug-in on that track. Depending on your host application, you may need to select it from a menu or drag and drop it onto the track. 3. Play back the track and listen for any noise problems. You can use the Before/After button to compare the original and processed audio. 4. Use the Hum & Rumble filters, Click & Crackle elimination, Broadband noise reduction, and Noise Gate sections as described above
