The film was released on September 11, 2009 and faced tough competition from other movies like Dil Bole Hadippa and Wanted. The film opened to a poor response at the box office and collected only Ã¢Â‚Â¹1.5 crore in its first week. The film's lifetime collection was Ã¢Â‚Â¹2.5 crore, making it a flop at the box office[^1^]. The film's poor performance was attributed to its weak promotion, low star value and lack of mass appeal.
 
Despite its failure at the box office, the film received some positive feedback from the audience who appreciated its message of hope and friendship. The film also showcased Bobby Deol's versatility as an actor who played a challenging role of a paraplegic patient with conviction. The film also marked the debut of child actor Dwij Yadav who won many hearts with his innocent and lively performance as Roshan. The film's music by Monty Sharma and Rahul Seth was also well-received and featured some melodious songs like Vaada Raha, Rab Na Kare and Aaj Aasmaan.
 
Vaada Raha I Promise is a film that deserves a watch for its sincere attempt to portray a touching story of two unlikely friends who overcome their hardships with courage and optimism. The film may not be a commercial success but it is definitely a soulful one.
