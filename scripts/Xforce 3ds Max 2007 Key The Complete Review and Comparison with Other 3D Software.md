## How do people crack Navionics charts?
 
One of the most popular methods to crack Navionics charts is to use a Python script that copies the data from an original Navionics SD card to an empty SD card with a modified CID (card identification number). The script also extends the expiry date of the subscription and bypasses the copy protection mechanism. The script was posted on Reddit[^1^] by a user named marine\_hacker in 2018, along with step-by-step instructions on how to use it.
 
## What are the risks of cracking Navionics charts?
 
Cracking Navionics charts is not only illegal, but also risky. Here are some of the potential consequences of using cracked Navionics charts:
