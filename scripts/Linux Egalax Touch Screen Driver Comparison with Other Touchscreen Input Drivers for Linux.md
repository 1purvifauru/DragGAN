## How to Calibrate and Configure Egalax Touch Screen Driver?
 
After installing Egalax Touch Screen Driver on your Linux system, you may need to calibrate and configure it to make it work properly with your touch screen device. To do that, you need to follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and run the command xinput -list to list all the input devices on your system. Look for the device name that matches your touch screen device. For example, it may be something like eGalax Inc. USB TouchController.
2. Run the command xinput -list-props <device id=""> to list all the properties of your touch screen device. For example, if your device id is 12, you can type xinput -list-props 12.</device>
3. Look for the property name that matches libinput Calibration Matrix or Coordinate Transformation Matrix. This is the property that controls how your touch screen coordinates are mapped to your screen resolution.
4. Run the command xinput -set-prop <device id=""> <property name=""> <matrix values=""> to set the calibration matrix for your touch screen device. For example, if your device id is 12, your property name is libinput Calibration Matrix, and your matrix values are 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1, you can type xinput -set-prop 12 libinput Calibration Matrix 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1.</matrix></property></device>
5. You may need to adjust the matrix values according to your touch screen orientation and size. You can use a tool like xinput\_calibrator or eGTouchD (included in the driver package) to help you find the optimal values.
