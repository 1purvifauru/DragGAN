### What are the Benefits of KMS Activation?
 
KMS activation has some advantages over other methods of activating Windows, such as using a Multiple Activation Key (MAK) or a retail license. Some of the benefits of KMS activation are:

- KMS clients do not need to access the Internet or the phone to activate the product (only network access to the KMS host is required) [^3^]. This can save bandwidth and avoid potential activation errors due to network issues.
- KMS clients can activate multiple products with the same KMS host, such as Windows Server and Windows client, or different editions of Microsoft Office [^2^]. This can simplify the activation process and reduce the number of keys needed.
- KMS clients can activate automatically without user intervention, as long as they can contact the KMS host periodically [^2^]. This can improve user experience and productivity.
- KMS hosts can support an unlimited number of KMS clients [^2^]. This can make KMS activation scalable and suitable for large organizations.

### What are the Limitations of KMS Activation?
 
KMS activation also has some limitations that you need to be aware of before using it. Some of the limitations of KMS activation are:

- KMS clients need to have a specific product key (GVLK) installed on them to activate with a KMS host [^1^]. This may require some configuration changes if the clients were previously using a different activation method.
- KMS clients need to renew their activation every 180 days by contacting the KMS host [^2^]. If the KMS host is unavailable or unreachable for a long time, the clients may become unactivated and display a notification message.
- KMS hosts need to have a special key (CSVLK) that authenticates them with Microsoft [^2^]. This key is only available for volume licensing customers and needs to be activated online or by phone.
- KMS hosts need to meet a minimum activation threshold before they can activate other computers [^2^]. The threshold is 25 for clients and 5 for servers. This means that you need to have at least that many computers on your network that use KMS activation.
